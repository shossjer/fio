* Fast Input Output

  Some systems make it more difficult than others to output text to a
  console. This project makes console interaction, and other stream
  operations, easier (and sometimes faster).

** But why?

   * Windows need some extra care when dealing with Unicode. It does
     not help that they like to use UTF16LE (i.e. ~wchar_t~) in their
     API either.
   * Windows have additional difficulties in how it handles redirected
     streams.

** Benchmarks

   This library can be configured to build a benchmarking executable
   via the CMake option ~FIO_BUILD_BENCHMARKS~. When enabled, CMake
   will download and install third-party libraries to compare against
   but those can be disabled via the ~FIO_BUILD_~-family of options.

   Run the executable with the argument ~-l~ or ~--lists-tests~ in
   order to list all available benchmarks.

   For more details on the available commands, see the documentation
   of Catch2 (https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2).

*** Plots

    The benchmarks output ~.dump~-files (in the directory ~plot~) that
    can be plotted via ~GNU Octave~.
