* Fast Input Output

  Some systems make it more difficult than others to output text to a
  console. This project makes console interaction, and other stream
  operations, easier.

** But why?

   * Multi-threaded programs need syncing mechanisms in order to
     prevent garbled output.
   * Windows need some extra care when dealing with Unicode. It does
     not help that they like to use UTF16LE in their API
     (i.e. ~wchar_t~).
   * Windows have additional difficulties in how it handles redirected
     streams.
